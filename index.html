            <p>I'm Andrew Stalker, Mountain Leader and Climbing Wall Instructor.</p>

            <p>
                Having always been an outdoors kid and growing up on a farm, venturing into the wilderness nearly came as second nature. 
                I learned to climb at university and was soon teaching fellow students the good old figure of eight knot. This led me to working towards and passing my CWI, allowing me to continue to pass on the knowledge and passion there is for climbing. A sport that is welcoming to so many people and is a great social activity, it is great to see so many new climbers always coming to try out something new and get a grip (pun intended) with climbing walls. <br><br>

                Mountain environment and navigation was introduced to me at a young age and having grown up on a farm, the outdoors is my favourite place to be. Leading myself and others into the Mountains was a daunting task at first but several years of experience and becoming a Mountain Leader has truly expanded my comfort zone. Leading people to expand their own comfort zone, feel the buzz that comes after ascending a peak or traversing a great ridge is really rewarding. 
                For physical and mental health, there is no better place to be.
